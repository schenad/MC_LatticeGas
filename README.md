# MC_LatticeGas
This project is done in 2014, from the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) that I participated during my undergraduate study in HKUST. It is a simplified Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of Br atoms on Cu(111) surface based on lattice gas model (2-D), with 2 competing forces: bonding force between the nearest neighbor and repulsive force (‚àù1/r^3) between each of atom, without time-related factors like transition rates, thus this toy model only searches the most energetically favorable state for the configuration of atoms under two competing forces.  
The results are stunning. 3 different coverages generate 2 different patterns (the 10.92% is very similar to 71.95%). The most interesting case is when 33.65% of the surface is covered, the deposition of Br on Cu surface shows [turing patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern) with characteristic stripes in experiment, while my simulation shows very similar patterns. The turing pattern can be explained by [reaction-diffusion theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system). The local chemical reactions are compete with the global diffusion just like the local bonding is compete with global repulsive force. Although there is no chemical reaction in my system, similar pattern is formed and serves as a great example of [pattern formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_formation) with simple rules. In fact, in [classical nucleation theory] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_nucleation_theory), the density of nucleated island mainly depends on the competition between deposition flux (F) and diffusion energy (Ed), which may also explain the formation of turing pattern in my simulation.
